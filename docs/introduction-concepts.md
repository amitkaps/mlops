# Introduction & Concepts

## Expectations

* No fancy ML
* How to build and deploy 1000s of models per day

### Expectations from the participants

- Latest ML Ops Process (Level 1, 2, 3 & 4)
- Algorithm - vertical vs. horizontal scaling
- ML ops system design vs. devops system design
- 200 DS -> 100 experiments (dev, prod, canary)
- data labelling
- on prem / cloud - latency issues
- production -> ML engineering requirements -> large scale / QPS
- create your own platform deep learning (scale to DL)
- data management -> schema / sheets
- on call -> monitoring and failures -> data purge issues
- deployment modes -> shadow mode?
- concept / data drift
- deploy -> CLI / NFR Testing -> dev / prod -> transparency of the deployed infrastructure
- testing -> unit testing (for data)
- validation
